# Sudoko-Solver-Backtracking-
This project is a Python-based Sudoku solver that employs the backtracking algorithm. Sudoku is a popular number-placement puzzle where the goal is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 sub-grids contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.
# Features:

-Backtracking Algorithm: Utilizes a recursive backtracking approach to efficiently solve Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulties.
-User-friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive interface for users to input puzzles and view solutions.
Efficient Solution: The solver efficiently explores possible solutions, significantly reducing computation time.
Validations: Ensures that the input Sudoku puzzle is valid before attempting to solve it.

# Usage:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Run the C++ script to launch the Sudoku Solver.
Input the Sudoku puzzle using the provided code.


# How it Works:
The solver employs a recursive algorithm that explores the possible placements for each empty cell. If a valid solution is found, it proceeds; otherwise, it backtracks to the previous state and tries a different approach.
