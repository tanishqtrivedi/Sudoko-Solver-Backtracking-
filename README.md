# Sudoko-Solver-Backtracking-
This project is a Python-based Sudoku solver that employs the backtracking algorithm. Sudoku is a popular number-placement puzzle where the goal is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 sub-grids contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.
